# Executive Summary

In the world of education in India, there is a significant issue that needs our attention. It pertains to students who face a particularly tough challenge - they are often referred to as "slow learners." For these students, their academic journey can be a daunting and frustrating experience. They not only struggle to keep up with their classmates, but this struggle also takes a toll on their self-esteem, causing high levels of anxiety, and sometimes even leading to depression. The concern is not limited to the students alone; it deeply affects their parents as well. Parents often find themselves in a state of helplessness and intense worry regarding their child's future. It is a serious issue that demands our focus and a novel solution.

To address this problem, we propose an innovative solution: an online platform powered by artificial intelligence (AI) and the magic of storytelling. This platform aims to tackle the intricate educational challenges faced by slow learners head-on. It seeks to transform educational materials into engaging stories presented in the form of flashcards. This approach makes learning not just informative but also enjoyable, and it is a significant step towards helping these students overcome their difficulties. We recognize that children effortlessly remember movie dialogues while struggling to retain school knowledge. Our approach delivers academic knowledge in the form of engaging stories, ensuring that learning becomes a delightful journey.

## Problem Statement

In the landscape of education in India, a pressing challenge is the significant population of students designated as "slow learners," comprising approximately 10-12% of the student body. This categorization signifies a formidable struggle for these students, manifesting in difficulties comprehending and keeping pace with traditional teaching methods. The ramifications extend beyond academic hurdles, delving into the realm of heightened emotional distress, including low self-esteem, increased anxiety, and, in severe cases, depression.

The gravity of this challenge becomes more apparent when considering the cascading effects on these students' futures. Hindered by the constraints of conventional learning approaches, slow learners often face hurdles in grasping essential concepts. Parents, too, bear witness to their children's struggles, grappling with a pervasive sense of helplessness and deep-seated worry regarding the long-term implications for their child's educational journey and overall well-being.

This problem statement is substantiated by statistics indicating the prevalence of slow learners in the educational system, shedding light on the magnitude of the issue. The conventional methods employed in classrooms often fall short in catering to the diverse learning needs of these students, exacerbating the challenges they face. User stories further underscore the poignant narratives of slow learners and their families, emphasizing the need for a tailored and effective solution that transcends the limitations of traditional education.
