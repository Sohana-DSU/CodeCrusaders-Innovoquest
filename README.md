Developing an MVP involves crafting a minimal yet functional frontend, prioritizing key user interactions. Iterative development and feedback refinement drive this process. Uploading the frontend to GitHub repository facilitates collaboration, version control, and further enhancements.

## GitHub Workflow Overview

This GitHub Actions workflow automates the DevSecOps lifecycle for our application. It consists of several phases, each performing specific tasks related to security, testing, and deployment. Here's an overview of the key points:

## 1. Build

- **Objective:** Merge and build the code to identify conflicts and ensure successful integration.
- **Tools:** GitHub Actions, Python.

## 2. Unit Testing with Pytest

- **Objective:** Perform unit testing to validate code quality, identify common errors, and generate a test report.
- **Tools:** GitHub Actions, Pytest.

## 3. Push Main to Security Branch

- **Objective:** Create and push code to the "security" branch for security checks.
- **Tools:** GitHub Actions, Git.

## 4. SAST Testing with Bandit

- **Objective:** Perform Static Application Security Testing (SAST) using Bandit to detect common security errors.
- **Tools:** GitHub Actions, Bandit.

## 5. DAST Testing with OWASP ZAP

- **Objective:** Perform Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) using OWASP ZAP to find vulnerabilities in the web application.
- **Tools:** GitHub Actions, OWASP ZAP.

## 6. Push Security to Preprod

- **Objective:** Push the secured code to the "preprod" branch.
- **Tools:** GitHub Actions, Git.

## 7. Push Preprod to Prod

- **Objective:** Push the preproduction code to the "prod" branch to make it production-ready.
- **Tools:** GitHub Actions, Git.

- Ansible
- Kubernetes

**GitHub Workflow:** Deployment.

## 7. Monitor

**Objective:** Continuously monitor and secure the application.

**Activities:**
- Continuously monitor the application.
- Address and resolve issues as they arise.

**Tools:**
- Monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus).
- Automated security monitoring and response tools.
- Cloudtrail (For logging user activities)
- Cloudwatch (for setting alarms on high resource usage)

**GitHub Workflow:** Operations and Monitoring.

## 8. Operate

**Objective:** Ensure the continuous operation and monitoring of the application.

**Activities:**
- Grafana labs (for visualization)
- Google analytics 4 (for operations)

### Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)

- Perform DAST tests to identify vulnerabilities.

### Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST)

- Utilize IAST tools for interactive testing.

**Tools:**
- DAST tools (e.g., OWASP ZAP).
- IAST tools (e.g., Selenium).

**GitHub Workflow:** Security Testing and Monitoring.

### Documentation

**Objective:** Create and maintain documentation.

**Activities:**
- Use Confluence for documentation and collaboration among team members.

**Tools:**
- Confluence

**GitHub Workflow:** Documentation and Collaboration.

## Modules to Download

Before you begin, make sure you have the necessary Python modules and dependencies installed:

- Flask
- spacy
- requests
 and others
You can install these modules using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Download the files in the repo

It is advisable to download all the files into a separate folder as the templates and static folder interact with the flask code in the app.py file

## Run the Flask application

```bash
python app.py
```
The development server will start, and you will see output indicating that the server is running.

## Open a web browser and navigate to

```Link:
http://127.0.0.1:3000/
```

[Localhost URL](http://127.0.0.1:3000/)

If your using the docker container, use the link

## For the docker container

Build the Docker container:
```bash
docker build -t my-flask-app .
```
Run the Docker container:
```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 my-flask-app
```
And for the link:

Access the application at:
```Link:
http://localhost:3000/
```
[Localhost URL](http://localhost:3000/)

These commands build a Docker container for a Flask web application and run it on port 3000, making the application accessible at http://localhost:3000/.

## After the site is open

You should see the "Flashcard Generator" web application.

Enter a sentence into the input field and click the "Generate Flashcards" button. This will trigger the image download and flashcard generation process.

The generated flashcards with images and the entered sentence will be displayed on the web page.

## How to create requirements.txt for python packages

Go to the command prompt in the directory with the app files:

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

## To see the software versions installed in your system

Run the Software_versions_script.bat file. It will create a text file that states the software versions used in your system. You can compare it with the DeveloperSoftwareversion.txt file which is present in the Software versions folder if there any version compatability issues. The SoftwareVersions.txt file is under .gitignore so you can run it on the same folder without any issues.
